// Let's create a new file in the JS folder, named main.js
//and add our programming.

$(".animsition").animsition();


//First, we select the outer div for the page, the one we added the class name to.
//Then we call the plugin on that selection.
//This runs the special programming in the plugin, and yes, that's it!
//That's all we need for now.
// 6:42

// Let's link this new JavaScript file to our web page.
// 6:46

// This goes after all the other scripts,
// 6:48

// because it's dependent on both the plugin and jQuery files.
// 6:52

// I'll save the files, and preview the workspace.
// 6:56

// When I click a link, notice that the homepage fades out.
// 7:00

// However, the other pages on the site don't do anything.
// 7:03

// That's because we haven't added the proper code for them.
// 7:06

// That's your assignment right now.
// 7:08

// Add the required code to the other two pages in this site.
// 7:11

// That is, link to the CSS file, the JavaScript files, and add the proper
// 7:17

// HTML markup to the Team.html and Work.html pages.
// 7:22

// If you get it working, you should see a simple fade out,
// 7:25

// fade in transition between all the pages in the site.
// 7:29

// In the next video, we'll look at how to customize this plugin
// 7:32

// by passing a JavaScript object literal with configuration settings.
// 7:37

// See you there.
