// Let's create a new file in the JS folder, named main.js
//and add our programming.

$(".animsition").animsition();


//First, we select the outer div for the page, the one we added the class name to.
//Then we call the plugin on that selection.
//This runs the special programming in the plugin, and yes, that's it!
//That's all we need for now.
